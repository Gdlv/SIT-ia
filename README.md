## Keywords:
 Pest management, Male sorting, SIT Spotted wing Drosophila

 
## Main Points:
•  	Sterile only-males release is key to success in SIT application and may be resolved by using AI for sex sorting insects.

•  	We develop software and hardware to detect males and females and tested it on D. suzukii 

•  	The rate of SIT-ia software-hardware system differentiated males from females with a 98.6% accuracy.

•  	The SIT-ia can sort 1000 flies 40 minutes faster than trained experts.


## Abstract:
Invasive insects may cause significant economic impacts to agriculture worldwide and impact human health. Traditional pest management methods that include chemical insecticides have raised increasing environmental and health concerns, prompting the need for sustainable alternatives. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) which consists of releasing sterile males of a target pest, to mate with wild females is held as a promising solution. However, the success of SIT often relies-among several issues- on the release of sterile males only and hence and efficient separation sexes prior to sterilization and release is warranted. This study presents SIT-ia, a software-hardware system that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision to automate the sex-sorting process. We showcase its use with the damaging fruit fly D. suzukii. The system was able to identify males from females with 98.6% accuracy, sorting 1,000 sterile flies in ~70 minutes, which is nearly half the time involved in manual sorting by experts (i.e., ~112 minutes). This simple device can easily be adopted in SIT protocols, improving the feasibility and efficacy of improved pest management practices.
